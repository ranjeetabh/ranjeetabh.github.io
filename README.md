# Musical_File_Processing

This project aims to work with a audio feature CSV file consisting of around ~10,000 records which is a subset of Million Songs Dataset provided by Columbia university and pulled from Echonest (https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/). The input file will be processed, cleaned and programatically evaluated to generate some visualization plots. The code rubric reflects the following programming constructs:

-> A custom library (with classes, functions, and constants)

-> Iteration and decision making

-> Imports from custom library and the standard library

-> File I/O - Reading from an input file and creating an output file.

-> The use of a data structure (queue).

-> The use of object orientation, inheritance. 

There are three files as part of this project:

-> main_program.py - Core script

-> dataset_research.py - User defined module consisting for custom libraries, functions.

-> MusicDataset_input.csv - Input CSV file.
